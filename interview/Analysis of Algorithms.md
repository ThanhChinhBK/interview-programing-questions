1. **3-SUM in quadratic time.** Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 in the worst case. You may assume that you can sort the nn integers in tim e proportional to n^2 or better.

	**Solution**: sort before couting. In a firt for loop, given an integer x , and a sorted array a[] of n distinct integers, design a linear-time algorithm to determine if there exists two distinct indices i and j such that a[i]+a[j]==-x.

2. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of nn distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

	* Standard version: Use 3lgn compares in the worst case.
	* Signing bonus: Use 2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than 2lgn compares in the worst case).
