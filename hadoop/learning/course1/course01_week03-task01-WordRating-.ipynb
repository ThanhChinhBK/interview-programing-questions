    "1. __Backup your solution into the 'work' directory inside the home directory ('/home/jovyan'). It is the only one that state will be saved over sessions.__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please, ensure that you call the right interpreter (python2 or python3). Do not write just \"python\" without the major version. There is no guarantee that any particular version of Python is set as the default one in the Grading system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One cell must contain only one programming language.\n",
    "E.g. if a cell contains Python code and you also want to call a bash-command (using “!”) in it, you should move the bash to another cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our IPython converter is an improved version of the standard converter Nbconvert and it can process most of Jupyter's magic commands correctly (e.g. it understands \"%%bash\" and executes the cell as a \"bash\"-script). However, we highly recommend to avoid magics wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints for the YARN tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please, use relative HDFS paths, i.e. dir1/file1 instead of /user/jovyan/dir1/file1. When you submit the code it will be executed on a real Hadoop cluster. For instance, user ‘jovyan’ may not exist there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hadoop counters’ names should have only small latin letters. One exception: only the first letter of the name can be in upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Hadoop logs the counter of stop words should be before the counter of total words. For doing this please take into account that the counters are printed in the lexicographical order."
